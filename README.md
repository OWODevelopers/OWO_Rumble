# OWO_Rumble
This mod is based on the work of [Florian](https://github.com/floh-bhaptics).

## Warning
Let me be very clear up front: Rumble is a multiplayer game. If you try to cheat via mods, you are likely going to get your account banned, and nobody will like you. Even with this workaround, Rumble will know that you are running a mod, and it will tell you right at startup that it knows. This mod here should be fine, it is not cheating and only provides additional immersive feedback, as anyone can see in this source code.

## Installation
Get the MelonLoader installer and install the latest version of MelonLoader on your game executable. Download the latest release of the mod and unzip the contents into the Mods directory of your game. That's it. Start your OWO app in the same network, connect to the OWO skin, and start up the game.

## Manual Connection
If you are having trouble with the automatic connection, create a .txt file called OWO_Manual_IP.txt and write the IP of where you placed the OWO mod.
